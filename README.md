### Hi there 👋

I'm a **passionate** software craftsman currently using `Ruby`, `Python`, `PHP`, `MongoDB` and `Angular`.

I'm also a Smalltalk and Ruby lover ❤️.

Java sucks 🤮 and, while you read these lines, a new 💩 React state management library is being released.

You can find me ranting on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cperezabo), always willing to talk about Object thinking, Test-Driven Development and eXtreme Programming.
